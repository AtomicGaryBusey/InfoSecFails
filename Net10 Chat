Net10: Thank you for visiting Net10 today. How may I help you?
You: I've been asking on Twitter about the plaintext emailing of passwords. I'd love to chat more about this.
Vince: Hi Valued Customer. Thank you for visiting NET10 Wireless.
Vince: I understand, but I am from NET10 Wireless.
You: I'm talking about Net10 emailing plaintext passwords. I've been tweeting about it on Twitter. One of your Twitter people told me I could engage with Net10 via this chat.....
Vince: I understand. Are you trying to log in to your NET10's My Account?
You: No. I'm concerned about Net10's practice of emailing user passwords in plaintext.
Vince: What do you want to know about it?
You: I'd like to know why Net10 engages in this practice even though it's very poor from a security standpoint.
Vince: We only do that if the person requesting for the password is able to answer the account security information. We don't keep the My Account password. We only reset the password and send it to that person's e-mail address.
You: That is false. I was able to obtain the plaintext password for my account simply by putting my email address into the Forgot Password? page.
Vince: The Forgot Password option allow us to send you a reset password link to your e-mail address where you can set up a new password.
You: No it doesn't. It sends me my actual password in the email.
Vince: A new plain text password will be sent to you if you are assisted by a representative, either through chat or call.
You: No, that's not what's actually happening with your system. Net10 is sending me my literal actual password in an email and the only thing I have to do to get it to do that is enter my email address on the Forgot Password page.
Vince: If that's what you say. The only thing we know is we'll send you a reset password link using the Forgot Password option on the website.
Vince: Is there anything else that I can assist you with?
You: This has been a disappointing discussion, Vince. Is there any way you can provide me with an email address or phone number for someone in your security department?
Vince: No, we don't have that information.
You: Ok, thank you. Have a good night.
Vince: You are welcome. You too. Is there anything else that I can assist you with?
You: No, I don't think there is.
